# Working
The program goes through every file and looks at the extension, then it matches the file extension to see if it matches with any type, then using Shutil library, it moves the file to the directory type.

## Example
PDFs, DOCX, or PPTX files are considered as Documents whereas MKV, WEBM, MP4 files are considered as Videos. So if the program goes through the file with extension .docx then, it moves the file into Documents folder and if the file is having .mkv file extension, then it moves the file into Videos folder.

## Points to be noted
* It only works in Linux right now, but later on Windows support will be added. 
* If you have Xtreme Video Downloader installed then it will also go through Downloader type folder (eg : Documents, Video)
